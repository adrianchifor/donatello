Crypto tipping bot for Github projects

## What does it do?

Donatello is a bot for tipping contributors in open source projects hosted on Github. 

The owner of a repository sets up a crypto wallet with some funds. It can then reward good PRs by sending some funds to the contributors' wallet.

This is automated: the repo's owner adds a comment to the PR with the following string 

```\tip ${amount}```

 This triggers the bot to transfer the amount to the contributor's  wallet. 

 If the wallet account number of the contributor is not available, the bot will post a request for it, and after receiving the answer, will trigger the payment.
